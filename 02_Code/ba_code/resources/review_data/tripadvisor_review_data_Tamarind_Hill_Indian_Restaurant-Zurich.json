The service was with a smile , beer was served at the right temperature , the naan and the samosa were ok. However the quality of lamb in the lamb Roganjosh was terrible , the sauce was tomato pur\u00e9e paste with a lot of cream . Totally devoid of taste . The tandoori chicken was dry and colored red . No hint of tandoori spices . However I must say that it seems to be a popular place with a mix of Indian and local guests . This is despite the food being way below standard which was very surprising. Probably because the service is good (???)

I must admit, I had rather high expectations which were not met. The restaurant had a strange arrangement like a pub with high pub stools and dining area around it. That made it really crowded, there was very little space between the neighbouring tables. The background music was rather loud and made conversation difficult. On top of it, one could easily hear people talking on tables next to you than the one sitting opposite you. We ordered mango lassi as we always do when we try a new Indian restaurant in Switzerland. I would say it was rather thin and with faint hint of mango, it could have been refreshing on a hot summer day but I have to admit, I have had better and richer mango lassis in other Indian restaurants in Switzerland. Our starters were beautifully presented and tasted OK. What we missed totally with the starters was chutneys, sauces. They were there in very small quantities more like food decoration than something you could enjoy as a dip. Our table was a bit wobbly and I had to ask twice to the staff to put a filling under the table so that it stablizes. They finally did it. By then, I was already feeling disillusioned about the whole experience but was surprized how full the restaurant was. It seems indeed it is a very popular restaurant in the area with some Indian families and majority of locals. My vegetarian main course was good but not exactly rich and flavourful as they describe themselves on the website: authentic and richly flavourful indian meals.

Just don't do it... the starter is almost same portion as the main course with half the price so guess what I will recommend order two starters insteadAh one more point, probably it was Friday, so they have maybe too many part time waiters and waitresses, which makes them have nothing to do lol. So they just keep coming around and take whatever they can from your table and keep asking you if everything is ok. At the end, even wanna take the empty glasses while we are talking lol.

The owner/manager greeted us warmly and we were well attended to by the colourfully clad waitresses and smart waiters. If anything, the food arrived a little too quickly for my liking but not everyone is looking for a long, relaxed evening. I did not, however, feel that they were rushing us out the door.The prices seemed steep until we had experienced a day or two in Zurich and realised that (at least for post-Brexit vote Sterling) everything is very expensive. In fact their prices were comparatively reasonable, especially for the excellent draft beer.Had we known just how generously portioned the Thalis are we would not have bothered with starters, which were fine and nicely presented but nothing special taste-wise. The Thalis were exceptional, however, being not only plentiful but really delicious (without being over-spicy) and nicely presented. I am a very big eater but couldn't finish my lamb thali.A great atmosphere, good value, attentive and smiling service, delicious food and a tram stop straight to our hotel. What more could you want?

Zum Ap\u00e9ro Drinks bestellt (wir wurden von 3 verschiedenen Personen nach unseren Getr\u00e4nkew\u00fcnschen befragt, weder Person 2 noch 3 wussten, dass wir bereits bestellt hatten), die kamen dann auch innert halbwegs n\u00fctzlicher Frist und h\u00fcbsch angerichtet. Dann einen gemischten Vorspeisenteller bestellt .... nach ca. 45 Minuten kam auch dieser - und alle Speisen waren k\u00f6stlich. Danach nochmals 50 Minuten warten auf die Hauptspeisen - auch diese waren wunderbar zubereitet, grosses Lob an die K\u00fcche. An den Nachbartischen wurden Reklamationen laut betr. langer Wartezeiten - f\u00fcr mich war das jetzt kein sooo grosses Problem. Problematisch war dann halt schon, dass ein Teil der Bestellungen vergessen ging ... eines (von 2 bestellten) Naanbroten - nach Reklamation und lange nach dem Servieren der Hauptspeisen noch zu bringen, wenn Letztere schon beinahe verspiesen waren ist halt schon auch ein wenig sp\u00e4t ... auf die Nachlieferung des zweiten vergessenen Brotes verzichteten wir nat\u00fcrlich.

We were very pleasantly surprised by absolutely excellent service and delicious food. Indian restaurants in Zurich tend to offer very spicy dishes and normally have very few dishes from the northern regions of India which are milder but not less aromatic and flavoursome. This restaurant as an exception and has a very good range of spicy and milder dishes. The food presentation is superb, very European. The staff is very friendly and attentive, they speak excellent English. Firstly we were offered very nice tasty bite-size papadams with their excellent home-made mint sauce. I had some chef's special starter of prawns with various very delicious sauces. My husband opted for potato and onion friters. I chose a traditional tandoori chicken (was pleasantly surprised to be able to choose legs or breasts as usually I have to specially ask for legs which I prefer), it was nicely cooked and did not have much artificial colouring. The garlic bread was tasty but slightly on the small size. My husband had some Rogan Josh lamb ehich was excellent. We were offered a complementary desert (panna cotta and ice-cream) which was delicious. I would highly recommend booking in advance as this place is very popular, especially towards the end of the week. They also offer very good lunch buffet.

The choice turned out to be well worth the money spent. The restaurant is really excellent in terms of ambience, service, hygiene, and above all, the taste of the dishes. We tried a Vegetarian Thali (cost 34.50 CHF) and shared between the two of us. Each and every item of the thali was superb in terms of taste, balanced spices and oil content and the freshness of the dishes. The thali contained one very big piece of nan, 3 vegetable dishes, one dal makhani, curd raita, papad, mint chutney, pickle and rice. The quantity was sufficient for both of us as we don't eat much. Amit was too good in service and suggesting us about the various options for vegetarians like us. The icing on the cake was the complimentary Mango Lassi served by the owner Akshay.
